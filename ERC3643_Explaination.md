# ERC-3643 Standard: Comprehensive Guide for Regulated Tokens

## What is ERC-3643 and Why It Was Created

### Overview
ERC-3643 (formerly T-REX Protocol) is an **official Ethereum standard** for permissioned tokens designed specifically for security tokens and regulated assets. It was approved as an official EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) in September 2021.

### Key Problems It Solves
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Traditional ERC-20 tokens are permissionless, but security tokens must comply with KYC/AML regulations
- **Identity Verification**: Need to verify investor eligibility before allowing token transfers
- **Transfer Restrictions**: Must enforce complex compliance rules (investor caps, geographical restrictions, etc.)
- **Governance Control**: Issuers need ongoing control over their tokens for corporate actions

### "Compliance by Design" Approach
ERC-3643 implements **"Compliance by Design"** - it's impossible for non-compliant investors to receive tokens. The system automatically validates every transfer against:
- Investor identity and credentials
- Regulatory compliance rules
- Token-specific restrictions

## Core Stakeholders and Their Roles

### 1. **Token Issuer** (Owner)
- **Role**: The company or entity issuing the security token
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Defines compliance rules and token parameters
  - Manages agent appointments
  - Performs corporate actions (dividends, voting, etc.)
  - Has ultimate control over token lifecycle

### 2. **Agents** 
- **Role**: Appointed by the issuer to perform operational tasks
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Mint/burn tokens
  - Force transfers when needed
  - Manage investor registry
  - Execute compliance operations
  - Can be automated smart contracts or human operators

### 3. **Identity Registry Manager**
- **Role**: Manages the whitelist of eligible investors
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Add/remove investors from registry
  - Verify investor identities
  - Manage country codes and restrictions
  - Link wallet addresses to on-chain identities

### 4. **Claim Issuers** (Trusted Third Parties)
- **Role**: Trusted entities that issue identity claims/certificates
- **Examples**: KYC providers, governments, law firms, auditors
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Issue signed claims about investor attributes
  - Provide identity verification certificates
  - Maintain claim validity

### 5. **Compliance Engine**
- **Role**: Automated system that enforces transfer rules
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Check global compliance rules (investor caps, etc.)
  - Validate transfer eligibility
  - Apply modular compliance rules
  - Generate compliance reports

### 6. **Investors**
- **Role**: Token holders who must maintain compliant status
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maintain valid on-chain identity
  - Hold required claims from trusted issuers
  - Comply with ongoing regulatory requirements
  - Self-custody their tokens

## How Token Transfers Are Approved or Restricted

### Transfer Validation Process
Every transfer goes through a **multi-layer validation system**:

#### Layer 1: Basic Checks
```
✓ Sender has sufficient unfrozen balance
✓ Neither sender nor receiver wallets are frozen
✓ Token contract is not paused
✓ Transfer amount is valid
```

#### Layer 2: Identity Verification (`isVerified()`)
```
✓ Receiver is whitelisted in Identity Registry
✓ Receiver has valid on-chain identity
✓ Required claims are present and valid
✓ Claims are signed by trusted issuers
✓ Claims match required topics
```

#### Layer 3: Compliance Rules (`canTransfer()`)
```
✓ Maximum number of investors not exceeded
✓ Geographical restrictions respected
✓ Investment limits per investor not breached
✓ Time-based restrictions (lock-up periods)
✓ Custom compliance rules satisfied
```

### Transfer Types and Their Rules

| Transfer Type | Identity Check | Compliance Check | Use Case |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| `transfer()` | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | Normal investor-to-investor transfers |
| `transferFrom()` | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | Delegated transfers (e.g., through exchanges) |
| `mint()` | ✓ Required | ✗ Bypassed | Token issuance to new investors |
| `forcedTransfer()` | ✓ Required | ✗ Bypassed | Agent/issuer initiated transfers |
| `burn()` | ✗ Bypassed | ✗ Bypassed | Token destruction |

## Smart Contract Architecture and Functions

### Core Smart Contracts

#### 1. **Token Contract** (ERC-3643)
```solidity
// Key functions for issuers/agents
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external;
function burn(address userAddress, uint256 amount) external;
function forcedTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external;
function setAddressFrozen(address userAddress, bool freeze) external;
function pause() external;
function recoveryAddress(address lostWallet, address newWallet, address investorOnchainID) external;

// Batch operations for efficiency
function batchMint(address[] calldata toList, uint256[] calldata amounts) external;
function batchTransfer(address[] calldata toList, uint256[] calldata amounts) external;
```

#### 2. **Identity Registry Contract**
```solidity
// Manages whitelist of eligible investors
function registerIdentity(address userAddress, IIdentity identity, uint16 country) external;
function deleteIdentity(address userAddress) external;
function isVerified(address userAddress) external view returns (bool);
function contains(address userAddress) external view returns (bool);
function investorCountry(address userAddress) external view returns (uint16);
```

#### 3. **Compliance Contract**
```solidity
// Enforces transfer rules
function canTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external view returns (bool);
function transferred(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external;
function created(address to, uint256 amount) external;
function destroyed(address from, uint256 amount) external;
```

#### 4. **Trusted Issuers Registry**
```solidity
// Manages approved claim issuers
function addTrustedIssuer(IClaimIssuer trustedIssuer, uint[] calldata claimTopics) external;
function removeTrustedIssuer(IClaimIssuer trustedIssuer) external;
function getTrustedIssuers() external view returns (IClaimIssuer[] memory);
```

#### 5. **Claim Topics Registry**
```solidity
// Defines required claim types
function addClaimTopic(uint256 claimTopic) external;
function removeClaimTopic(uint256 claimTopic) external;
function getClaimTopics() external view returns (uint256[] memory);
```

## On-Chain Identity and Claims System

### Identity Architecture
Each participant has an **on-chain identity contract** that:
- Stores cryptographic keys
- Holds signed claims/certificates
- Links to specific wallet addresses
- Remains reusable across multiple tokens

### Claims Structure
Claims are **signed attestations** that prove specific attributes:

```
Claim Structure:
{
  topic: uint256,        // What the claim is about (e.g., KYC = 1, Accreditation = 2)
  issuer: address,       // Who issued the claim
  signature: bytes,      // Cryptographic proof
  data: bytes,          // Claim data (encrypted for privacy)
  validity: uint256     // Expiration timestamp
}
```

### Common Claim Topics
- **Topic 1**: KYC/Identity verification
- **Topic 2**: Accredited investor status
- **Topic 3**: Geographical eligibility
- **Topic 4**: AML clearance
- **Topic 7**: Legal entity verification
- **Custom topics**: Token-specific requirements

### Identity Verification Flow
1. **Investor** creates on-chain identity
2. **KYC Provider** verifies investor and issues claims
3. **Claims** are stored in investor's identity contract
4. **Token contract** validates claims during transfers
5. **Registry** maintains whitelist of verified identities

## Practical Use Cases
